              Hello world! Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Ruan Victor, born
              and raised in Pedro II - PI. I am currently a Frontend Developer
              and one of the organizers of the Code Warriors developer
              community, a community focused on sharing knowledge in the tech
              area.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-justify">
              I started in the area in 2018 when I had contact with programming
              during the <strong>Computer Technician</strong> course at IFPI -
              Pedro II Campus and, later, I started higher education in{" "}
              <strong>Systems Analysis and Development</strong> at the same
              institution. Since then, I have been improving myself,
              participating in events, meeting people, and exploring the entire
              world of technology.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-justify">
              My main technical skills involving Frontend Development include:{" "}
              <strong>ReactJS</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>Tailwind</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. In addition to these, in Backend, I
              have basic knowledge through personal projects with{" "}
              <strong>NodeJS</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>. I have slight
              experience with design (creating web application layouts with the{" "}
              <strong>Figma</strong> tool), I also have knowledge of agile
              development (<strong>SCRUM</strong> and <strong>Kanban</strong>{" "}
              methodologies) and soft skills for collaborative work aimed at
              communication and the delivery of valuable products.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-justify">
              In addition to coding, I am a big fan of mobile games, books and
              dabbling in chess. And, of course, I like to have a coffee while I
              do all this! After all, who doesn't like coffee? ☕
